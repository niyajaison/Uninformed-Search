# Uninformed-Search
Implement a search algorithm that can find a route between any two cities. 
The program will compute a route between the origin city and the destination city, and will print out both the length of the route and the list of all cities that lie on that route. 
For example,
find_route input1.txt Bremen Frankfurt 

should have the following:

distance: 455 km
route:
Bremen to Dortmund, 234 km 
Dortmund to Frankfurt, 221 km
